# singlelinkedlist.hpp

This contains a simple single linked list implementation that basically works as a stack. There are better single linked lists out there, just take a peek
at STL and Boost. But I wanted to see if I can still write one and get it
relatively bug free.

This list is not fast, it is not thread-safe, it is not fancy. But it seems to work.
